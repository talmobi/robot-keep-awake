# About
Taps the SHIFT key with robotjs to keep computer awake and not enter suspend/sleep mode..

# Why
Ever used a laptop to test/livereload your web applications that you don't have full control over ( e.g. company laptops )?

Or you're executing long running tests?

Or simply having the laptop most of the time as an auxiliary screen?

And you can't change/access the hibernation/sleep settings?

And the screen goes black after 5 minutes?

This will prevent that from happening.
